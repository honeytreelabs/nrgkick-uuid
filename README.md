# nrgkick-uuid

In order to communicate with the NRGkick, a UUID is required. This UUID must be added to the NRGkick and subsequently specified during communication.

The [index.html](./index.html) in this repository allows for setting the UUID via a web browser through the WebSocket protocol. Download this file to your computer and open it in your preferred web browser. Complete the form that appears on your screen, and kick the UUID into your charging cable as necessary.
